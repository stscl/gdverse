Description: Detecting spatial associations via spatial stratified heterogeneity, accounting for spatial dependencies, interpretability, complex interactions, and robust stratification. In addition, it supports the spatial stratified heterogeneity family described in Lv et al. (2025)<doi:10.1111/tgis.70032>.
